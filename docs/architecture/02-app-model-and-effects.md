# App model, messages and effects

> **Status:** Implemented.
> **Last verified:** 2026-10-21, by source review and the headless suite.
> **Source:** `src/core/model.zig`, `src/core/msg.zig`, `src/core/update.zig`,

## The contract in one paragraph

The app is a `Model` (what is true), a `Msg` (what happened) and `update`
(what is true now). `update` is pure with respect to the outside world: it
mutates the model and may request an effect, but it never performs I/O.
Effects deliver their results back as messages. Markup binds model values
and dispatches messages; it never mutates.

This shape is what makes the app headlessly testable: build a model,
dispatch a message the way the runtime would, assert on the model and the
rebuilt tree.

## Model

`src/core/model.zig` owns all state. The struct is large (fixed buffers),
so `main.zig` constructs it with `UiApp.create` on the heap rather than
passing it by value.

### State groups

| Group | Fields | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Session | `role`, `role_chosen`, `signed_in`, `employee_id`, `employee_name` | The PIN hash never lives in the model; `resetSession` is the only teardown |
| Navigation | `screen_index`, `nav_section`, `stack`, `rail_split`, `menu_split`, `now_ms` | Screen index is an enum ordinal; the enum is append-only; the stack is session history (ADR-0015) |
| Company | `company_id`, `company_name`, `currency_code`, `currency_symbol`, `tax_inclusive` | One company per database |
| Datasets | seven bump buffers and seven row slices | Products, tables, employees, orders, customers, categories, order lines |
| POS filters | `selected_category`, `search` | 0 means "all"; search is a `TextBuffer(64)` |
| Sign-in | `pin`, `pin_salt_buf`, `salt_state`, `login_hash`, `operator_buf`, `login_error` | The salt is only usable once the database has confirmed it |
| Cart | `cart_buf`, `cart[50]`, `cart_len`, `cart_order_type` | Session state, never persisted until placed |
| Runtime | `db_ready`, `busy`, `error_text`, `theme_dark` | `error_text` is shown by the shell's dismissable error banner |

### Visibility rules

1. **Everything the view can see is declared inside the `Model` body.**
   A `pub fn` at file scope next to the struct is invisible to the
   binding resolver. This is the most common porting trap.
2. **Derived values are methods, never stored fields.** Examples:
   `product_count`, `open_order_count`, `cart_total_minor`,
   `visible_products(arena)`, `cart_lines(arena)`, `kitchen_tickets(arena)`.
3. **Anything the view must not see is listed in `view_unbound`.**
   Current entries: `stack`, `employee_id`, `db_ready`, `busy`,
   `company_id`, `theme_dark`, `salt_state`, `last_issued_order_id`,
   `advance_order_id`. The view reads errors through the derived
   `has_error` and `error_message` methods.
4. **Rows are plain data.** The markup cannot call a method on a row, so
   labels (`status_label`, `type_label`) are resolved at decode time and
   stored in the row.

### Fixed-capacity storage

The model must be default-constructible (`UiApp.create` builds `.{}` and
the model-contract checker does the same), so it cannot own a heap
allocator. Rows live in `bump.Bump(capacity)` byte buffers:

| Buffer | Capacity | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `products_buffer` | 96 KiB | Menu rows and their names |
| `tables_buffer` | 24 KiB | Floor rows |
| `employees_buffer` | 16 KiB | Staff rows |
| `orders_buffer` | 64 KiB | Order rows |
| `customers_buffer` | 32 KiB | Customer rows |
| `categories_buffer` | 16 KiB | Category rows |
| `order_lines_buffer` | 48 KiB | Order line rows |
| `cart_buf` | 8 KiB | Cart line names + order number |
| `operator_buf` | 1 KiB | Signed-in operator name |

Rules:

- `reset()` before replacing a dataset; otherwise old rows leak into the
  new set.
- A full bump drops the row (`alloc` returns `null`), it never grows.
- `dupe()` copies text; decoding must copy because page bytes are drain
  scratch.
- `allocSlice(T, n)` is how a decoded row set lands in the model.

Capacity is a product limit, not an implementation detail. A menu that
does not fit is a menu the app cannot show; see
[`plan/open-questions.md`](../plan/open-questions.md).

## Messages

`Msg` is a `union(enum)` in `src/core/msg.zig`. Three families:

| Family | Examples | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime-delivered | `pin_edit`, `search_edit`, `tick`, `*_loaded`, `db_failed` | Fixed by the platform: text edit event, timer event, DB result |
| App-intent | `pick_role`, `open_section`, `add_to_cart`, `place_order`, `advance_order`, `toggle_theme` | Small scalars so markup can dispatch `on-press="add_to_cart:{product.id}"` |
| Internal result | `login_checked`, `order_placed`, `order_status_saved`, `config_saved` | `EffectDbResult`; never bound by markup, listed in `Msg.view_unbound` |

Design notes:

- A payload must be a binding, not an arbitrary expression. That is why
  `set_category_all` exists: the "all" button cannot pass a literal `0`.
- Message names are the app's vocabulary. A new capability usually starts
  with a new `Msg`, not a new function call in markup.
- `Msg.view_unbound` is a lint surface: it keeps a runtime-only message
  from being accidentally dispatched by a template.

## Boot and effects

`boot` runs once:

```zig
pub fn boot(model: *Model, fx: *Effects) void {
    model.now_ms = fx.wallMs();
    fx.startTimer(.{
        .key = clock_timer_key,          // 100
        .interval_ms = 1000,
        .mode = .repeating,
        .on_fire = Effects.timerMsg(.tick),
    });
    repos.loadConfig(fx);                // first read: the PIN salt
}
```

Rules for effects:

- **Every effect has a caller-chosen `u64` key.** Keys live in
  `repos.zig`: reads 1–10, writes 20–22, timer 100. A query and a write
  must not collide.
- **Effects never write the model.** The result arrives as a message;
  only `update` mutates.
- **Effect payloads are drain scratch.** A result is valid for the
  duration of the update that receives it. Copy anything you keep.
- **Effects are fakeable.** `Effects.init(allocator)` plus
  `fx.executor = .fake` records requests instead of touching the OS,
  which is how the tests observe `place_order` without a database.

Effect families currently used: `dbQuery`, `dbExec`, `startTimer`,
`wallMs`. The SDK also offers subprocess, fetch, files, key/value,
credentials, clipboard, notifications, audio, images, windows and
`hostRequest`; the target design uses `spawn` for sidecars, `fetch` for
cloud backup, `credentials*` for secrets and `playAudio` for the KDS
chime.

## Update

`update` is a single `switch` over `Msg`. Every arm answers one question:
"the world said this, so what is true now?"

Notable arms:

| Arm | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `pick_role` | Reset the session, set the role; kiosk roles sign in immediately and load data; PIN roles land on login |
| `submit_login` | Refuse unless the salt is confirmed; hash the PIN, query `employee` by `pin_hash` **and the session's role**, wait for `login_checked` |
| `login_checked` | On a row of the session's role: reset the session to home, set the operator, sign in, load data. On no row, or a row of another role: "Wrong PIN", clear PIN |
| `sign_out` / `pick_role_again` | Reset the session; a PIN role lands on login, a kiosk on the role picker |
| `open_screen` / `open_section` | Route through `go()`, which checks `rbac.allows` and pushes the stack |
| `go_back` | Pop; stay put at a root |
| `place_order` | Build an order from the cart and `dbExec` it |
| `order_placed` | Clear cart, go to confirmation, reload orders |
| `advance_order` | Compute next status and write status + history atomically |
| `*_loaded` | Decode a page into the model's bump buffers |
| `config_loaded` | Adopt the stored PIN salt, or mark the salt as "to be installed" on a fresh install |
| `config_saved` | The salt write came back: confirm the salt, or show the failure and keep it unconfirmed |
| `db_failed` | Map outcome to operator copy |
| `tick` | Refresh `now_ms` |

### Navigation guard

`go` is the only navigation primitive:

```zig
fn go(model: *Model, screen: Screen) void {
    if (!rbac.allows(model.role, screen)) {
        model.error_text = "This role cannot open that screen";
        return;
    }
    model.stack.push(screen);   // no-op on the current screen; oldest dropped at 32
    model.screen_index = screen.index();
    model.nav_section = sectionIndex(screen);
}
```

This is the replacement for a router `redirect:` guard. It is pure,
total, and directly unit-tested.

Sessions are the other half of navigation. `resetSession(model, gate)`
clears everything the operator owns, keeps the device settings, and
calls `resetTo(gate)`. A sign-in lands on the role's home; a sign-out
lands on the role's gate. The history never contains the previous
session, and Back at the first screen of a session stays there. See
[ADR-0015](../decisions/0015-session-scoped-navigation.md).

### Error handling

- The shell renders `error_text` in a dismissable banner (the `has_error`
  and `error_message` methods are the bound surface).
- Read failures set `error_text` and leave the previous data in place.
- Write failures set `error_text`, clear `busy`, and do not pretend the
  write happened.
- Outcomes map to copy: `busy` → "The database is busy - try again",
  `io_failed` → "Storage error", `corrupt` → "The database is damaged".
- There is no retry policy and no offline queue. That is a target
  behaviour, not current behaviour.

## Lifecycle summary

```
main.zig
  makeSalt (provisional)
  UiApp.create
  initialModel
  boot ──▶ timer + loadConfig
                 │
                 ▼
          config_loaded ──▶ adopt/create salt
                 │
                 ▼
          role picker ──▶ login (PIN) ──▶ resetSession(home) ──▶ loadAll
                     └──▶ kiosk sign-in ──▶ resetSession(board) ──▶ loadAll
```

Every session transition calls `resetSession` before it enters the next
session, so the next operator starts from the gate with no cart, filters,
forms or history from the previous one.

The salt is the one piece of state a PIN hash cannot be checked without,
so it has four states rather than a flag:

| State | What it means | What it allows |
|---|---|---|
| `unknown` | The database has not answered yet | Nothing may be hashed with the salt |
| `installing` | The database has no salt: this one will be installed with the operator | The setup may hash the operator's PIN with it |
| `verifying` | The write returned, but the database has not been read back | Nothing may be hashed until the stored salt is read |
| `confirmed` | The database holds this salt | A sign-in may hash with it |

`loadAll` currently loads company, categories, products, tables,
employees, orders and order lines. It does **not** load customers, even
though a repository exists. This is a status fact, not a design choice;
see [`plan/status.md`](../plan/status.md).

## Known weak points

These are documented rather than silently fixed, because the fix is a
decision:

1. **Order IDs are the wall clock in milliseconds and order numbers are
   seconds.** Two orders in the same second collide on the `UNIQUE`
   order number. See [ADR-0013](../decisions/0013-clock-based-order-ids.md).
2. **`busy` is set on write but most read paths do not set it**, so the
   UI cannot distinguish "loading" from "empty" for reads.
3. **`now_ms` is the only clock.** There is no monotonic clock and no
   handling for clock jumps backwards.
4. **The PIN is a fast digest.** Salted SHA-256 is a storage
   improvement, not adequate PIN security (B-027).

## Tests that pin this contract

- role picker is the first screen;
- kiosk role signs in, PIN role lands on login;
- a role cannot open a screen it may not use;
- the permission matrix is total;
- back returns to the previous screen, and back at a session root stays
  put;
- a full history drops its oldest entry, and pressing the current screen
  does not grow it;
- a role change and a sign-out clear the previous session;
- cart arithmetic and integer money;
- model reports derived numbers instead of storing them;
- layout survives a resize;
- page decoder handles NULL, INTEGER and TEXT;
- PIN hashing is deterministic and salt-dependent;
- a waiter's PIN does not open an admin session;
- a sign-in waits for the database to confirm the salt, and a failed
  salt write is not a confirmed salt;
- a second instance adopts the salt that is already stored;
- the shell gates the screens the enum says it does;
- every gated screen renders, inside the widget budget.
