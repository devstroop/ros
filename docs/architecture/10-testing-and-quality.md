## Philosophy

The architecture exists partly to make testing cheap:

- `update` is pure, so a test dispatches a message and asserts on the
  model;
- effects have a fake executor, so a test can observe requests without a
  database or a clock;
- markup is built from a model, so a test can assert that a landmark
  appears in the tree;
- the database has an in-memory migrated mode, so repository tests need no
  file.

A rule that lives only in a comment is a rule that breaks. The tests in
`src/tests.zig` are written as rules, not as coverage for its own sake.

## Current tests (15 authored)

| # | Test | What it pins |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The role picker is the first screen and lists the four roles | Initial model and first render |
| 2 | Picking a role that needs a sign-in lands on the PIN screen | Session gate |
| 3 | Picking a kiosk role signs the device in and opens its board | Kiosk path |
| 4 | A role cannot open a screen it may not use | RBAC guard |
| 5 | The permission matrix is total | Lock-out guarantees |
| 6 | Going back returns to the previous screen | Stack |
| 7 | The cart adds, counts and totals in minor units | Cart arithmetic |
| 8 | Money stays integer | No float money |
| 9 | A PIN is hashed, never stored | Salt and hashing |
| 10 | The page decoder reads the engine's dialect | Wire format |
| 11 | The model reports its own numbers instead of storing them | Derived values |
| 12 | The setup screen renders on a fresh installation | Setup gate and template |
| 13 | The POS screen renders with a menu and a cart | POS template |
| 14 | The order confirmation renders after a sale | Confirmation template |
| 15 | The layout survives a resize | Markup build + layout at 1280×800 |

The working tree also has 12 in-memory database tests (`tests_data.zig`);
with one generated test the runner reports 28. The RBAC
“matrix is total” test is tautological (the assertion is guarded by
the value it asserts); see the [documentation
audit](../review/docs-audit.md#d-007--the-rbac-matrix-test-is-tautological).

How they run:

```
native test apps/admin --yes
```

The test block in `main.zig` imports `tests.zig`. Markup tests resolve the
same import closure as the runtime, then build and finalize a tree, so a
broken template fails a unit test with a line/column diagnostic.

The fake effects channel is `Effects.init(allocator)` with
`fx.executor = .fake`. It records requests; it does not answer them. A test
that needs a DB result must construct one by hand (as the page decoder test
does) or bind an in-memory store.

## What is not tested

| Area | Risk |
|---|---|
| Repository SQL against a real migrated database | A typo is caught only at runtime |
| Write atomicity (order + lines) | No test inserts then reads back |
| Login success path | Only hashing is tested; the SQL match is not |
| `config_loaded` salt creation | Covered by the working-tree DB test; the provisional gate is still untested |
| Salt provisional race | Untested; see `plan/status.md` |
| Order ID collisions | Untested; the scheme is provisional |
| Decoders for categories/tables/employees/customers/orders/lines | Only the generic page reader is tested |
| Every screen template | Five of nine templates have no render test |
| Node budget | No assertion on `widget_nodes` |
| Error arms (`db_failed`, failed loads) | Copy and state are untested |
| Timer tick | Untested |
| Theme switch | The walkthrough presses the control and keeps a dark screenshot, and every text pair in both registers clears AA in `src/tests.zig`; no test compares the two registers field by field |
| Accessibility names | Left to SDK validation |
| Window resize below minimum | Untested |
| Sidecars | No code, no tests |

## Test layers (target)

| Layer | Tool | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pure update | `native test` | Model transitions, RBAC, cart, status machine | Partial |
| Markup build | `native test` | Every template builds for its model fixture and contains its landmark | Partial |
| Page decoder | `native test` | Every decoder against a hand-built page | Partial |
| Relational integration | `native test` + `openMemoryMigrated` | Migrate, insert fixtures, run repo SQL, assert rows | In progress (uncommitted; 25/25 pass) |
| Business calculations | `native test` | Tax, discount, rounding, split payment, against v1 tests as oracle | Planned |
| Live automation | `native automate` | Role picker → login → sale → KDS advance, node budget, non-blank GPU | Planned |
| Interop | External harness | Flutter app and native app converge on sync | Planned |

### Relational test recipe

```zig
var db = try native_sdk.relational_store.Database.openMemoryMigrated(
    testing.allocator,
    migrations,
);
defer db.deinit();

var fx = Effects.init(testing.allocator);
// The real executor: these tests exist to run SQL.
fx.bindRelationalStore(db.binding());

// seed, then drive fx.dbExec / fx.dbQuery exactly as the app does
```

This is how `saveOrder` should be proven: execute, then query `orders` and
`order_line` and assert both are present, then force a failure and assert
neither is.

### Automation smoke

Two jobs drive a live app headlessly. `smoke` proves each binary paints:

```
native build -Dautomation=true
# run under xvfb
native automate assert 'gpu_nonblank=true'
native automate screenshot <view>
native automate assert 'widget_nodes=<n>/1024'
```

One pixel on a canvas is not a sale, so `sale-smoke` runs
`scripts/smoke-sale.sh`, which walks setup → sign out → role picker → PIN
→ POS → add a dish → Place order → Orders, then hands the database the
admin wrote to the kiosk and asserts the same ticket on the kitchen board
and advances it. Every step is an `automate assert` against the snapshot,
so a shell gate pointing at the wrong ordinal fails the run rather than
rendering something plausible.

Two things the script has to survive:

- **Stale widget ids.** A view that refreshes on a timer rebuilds its tree,
  and an id read from one snapshot can be retired before the click carrying
  it arrives. Every press is repeated until the screen it expects actually
  appears; the app's own guards — a sale still being saved, an order
  already moving — make a repeated press safe instead of a second sale.
- **Names, not positions.** A widget is found by role and accessible name,
  matched literally, so a price carrying `$` is never read as a regex.

The same path exists as a headless test, "a sale at the till shows on the
orders board and the kitchen board", driven against a real migrated
database. The test proves the state machine; the job proves the binaries
and the screens an operator actually sees.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` has four jobs:

1. **verify** — installs the pinned Zig 0.16.0 and Node 24, builds or
   restores the SDK CLI, then runs `scripts/verify-all.sh`
   (`native check` + `native test`).
2. **smoke** — one matrix leg per app: builds with `-Dautomation=true`,
   runs under `xvfb`, and asserts `gpu_nonblank=true` plus a screenshot.
3. **sale-smoke** — runs `scripts/smoke-sale.sh` end to end and uploads the
   screens and app logs as an artifact, so a run that dies three screens
   into the walk is still diagnosable from the runner.
4. **package** — builds and signs the macOS artifacts.

Pinning matters: Zig 0.17 cannot parse the SDK, and Node 22 fails the
relational toolchain. A CI runner that "looks fine" will fail at step 1.

## Quality gates before a release

| Gate | Required |
|---|---|
| `native check` clean | Yes |
| `native test` green | Yes |
| Every `Screen` either rendered or explicitly unavailable | Yes |
| Node budget asserted for POS and orders | Yes |
| Order write/read-back test | Yes |
| Migration test on a copy of a real database | Yes |
| Receipt print on target hardware | Yes, if printing ships |
| Two-device sync convergence | Yes, if sync ships |
| Keyboard-only pass on POS and login | Yes |
| Contrast audit, light and dark | Yes |
| Crash-free 30-minute service run | Yes |

## Known testing hazards

1. **Markup tests are brittle to copy changes.** They find literal text
   ("Restaurant OS", "Sign in"). Changing display copy breaks tests; that is
   usually the right trade, but keep landmarks stable.
2. **Fake effects do not answer.** A test that expects a follow-up message
   must synthesize the result.
3. **The model is large.** Tests allocate it on the stack in some places;
   `UiApp.create` exists because that is risky in production.
4. **Line numbers in docs drift.** Anchor on symbols in tests and docs.
5. **No test covers the screen-index contract.** The most likely
   regression in this codebase is a new screen inserted in the middle of
   the enum, which silently remaps every gate in `app.native`. Add a test
   that asserts the ordinal of every rendered screen, or generate the
   gates.
