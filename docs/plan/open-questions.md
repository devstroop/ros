This page exists because the most expensive mistakes in a rewrite are the
questions nobody wrote down. It separates:

- **known unknowns** — we know we do not know;
- **unknown unknowns** — areas where we do not yet know what to ask;
- **questions we have answered** — kept briefly so they are not reopened.

An answer belongs here only when it is backed by evidence: a v1 code path,
a test, a spike, a hardware trial, a legal review, or an explicit product
decision. "Probably" is not an answer.

## How we will find out

| Method | Best for | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Read the v1 code path and its tests | Behaviour that already exists | Low |
| Capture golden flows from v1 (`native automate`, screen recordings) | Interaction and copy | Medium |
| Port a calculation with v1 tests as the oracle | Money, tax, rounding | Medium |
| Spike in the SDK (throwaway app) | Platform capability limits | Medium |
| Hardware trial | Printing, scanners, drawers | Medium/high |
| Operator interviews and shadowing | Workflow, workarounds, error cost | Medium |
| Pilot service in one restaurant | Everything the above missed | High |
| Telemetry (opt-in) | Real usage, failure rates | Medium + privacy work |
| Legal/accounting review | Receipts, tax, data retention | External |

Rule: a question that blocks a phase must have an owner and a resolution
date before that phase starts.

## A. Product behaviour we have not captured

| # | Question | Why it matters | How to resolve | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | What exactly does v1 do for tax: per product, per category, inclusive or exclusive, multiple slabs? | Every total and receipt depends on it | Read `order.function.dart`, port tests, confirm with an accountant | Product/Eng | Open |
| A2 | How are discounts applied: line, order, percentage, fixed, coupon, happy hour? | Affects the order write and reporting | v1 code + product decision | Product | Open |
| A3 | Are split payments, partial payments, tips, service charge or refunds in v1? | Payment schema and UI | v1 code + product | Product | Open |
| A4 | What is the void/refund policy and who may do it? | Audit, compliance, RBAC | v1 code + legal | Product | Open |
| A5 | What does "completed" mean: paid, served, or closed? | Status machine and reports | v1 code + interviews | Product | Open |
| A6 | Can an order be edited after placement, and which fields? | Immutability rule vs reality | v1 code + interviews | Product | Open |
| A7 | What are the waiter flows: transfer table, split bill, course timing, merge tables? | Waiter is one of four roles | v1 code + shadowing | Product | Open |
| A8 | What does the customer display actually show: one order, a queue, a carousel? | Display board design | v1 code + store visit | Product | Open |
| A9 | Does the kitchen route by station on day one? | `kds_station` schema is unused | v1 code + kitchen interview | Product | Open |
| A10 | Are modifiers required, and how are min/max enforced? | POS flow and order write | v1 code | Product | Open |
| A11 | What does a receipt legally require in each target market? | Printing and compliance | Legal/accounting review | Product | Open |
| A12 | Is a shift/X/Z report required, and what must it contain? | Compliance tables are unused | v1 code + accountant | Product | Open |
| A13 | Is loyalty used in practice? | Three tables exist, none used | Usage data / interviews | Product | Open |
| A14 | Are reservations used? | Table + validation exist, no UI | Usage data | Product | Open |
| A15 | What is the setup experience: wizard, import, or both? | A fresh install cannot log in today | v1 wizard code + interviews | Product | Open |
| A16 | Does a restaurant expect multi-company? | The schema enforces one | v1 usage + sales input | Product | Open |
| A17 | What are the error messages an operator can act on? | Error copy is currently technical | Shadowing + support tickets | Design | Open |
| A18 | Which reports does an owner actually open? | Report scope and queries | Usage data + interviews | Product | Open |
| A19 | What is the day boundary and timezone for reporting? | Epoch-ms is UTC; reports are local | Accountant + product | Product | Open |
| A20 | What happens when two waiters edit one table? | Shared model and sync | Interviews + pilot | Product | Open |
| A21 | Can a customer take the goods and settle later, and who may allow it? | An order now closes only when it is paid for, so "pay later" needs an explicit action | Interviews + product | Product | Open |
| A22 | Is the counter POS the `admin` app or the `service` app? | The three-app split puts `pos` and `payments` in `admin` today, which means the till is the dedicated machine. If the till is a counter tablet, the permission matrix and the partition both change. | Product decision + a store visit | Product | Open |
| A23 | Does the `service` app ever take money? | The waiter role cannot open `payments` today. If a waiter takes a card, the money must be replicated with the same discipline as the order. | Interviews + product | Product | Open |
| A24 | Does the kiosk app run one board or both? | A single `kiosk` binary serves the kitchen and the customer display; the device chooses at install. A restaurant wanting both on one screen is a different requirement. | Store visit | Product | Open |

## B. Data and migration

## C. Security, privacy and compliance

| # | Question | Why it matters | How to resolve | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | What is the threat model for a restaurant device? | PIN strength, kiosk exit, sync trust | Security review + interviews | Eng | **Answered** — [ADR-0016](../decisions/0016-what-a-pin-is.md) |

| C3 | Can we use a memory-hard KDF in the SDK, or a keychain pepper? | PIN brute-force resistance | Spike the SDK crypto surface | Eng | **Answered** — the SDK has no KDF; bcrypt is in Zig's standard library and wants four kilobytes, [ADR-0016](../decisions/0016-what-a-pin-is.md) |
| C4 | How should failed logins be throttled without locking out a rush? | Security vs service | Product + security | Product | **Answered** — five wrong PINs, then a minute's silence, [ADR-0016](../decisions/0016-what-a-pin-is.md) |
| C5 | What personal data is stored (customer phone/email), and for how long? | Privacy obligations | Legal review | Product | Open |

| C11 | Does the app need code signing/notarisation in every target market? | Release | Release engineering | Eng | Open |
| C12 | Is there a data-deletion/export request obligation? | Privacy | Legal | Product | Open |
| C13 | The SDK's text field has no password mode, so a PIN is typed in the clear. Is a masked field, or a keypad, acceptable in the SDK? | A PIN on screen is a PIN the customer sees | Ask the SDK, or work around it | Eng | Open |
| C14 | Should the PIN salt be per employee rather than per installation? | One cracked database then gives up every PIN | Needs a sign-in that identifies the employee first | Eng | Open |
| C15 | Where should the failed-PIN counter live, so that a restart does not clear it? | A counter a restart clears is a counter a restart is worth | Write it to the database | Eng | Open |

## D. Sync

| # | Question | Why it matters | How to resolve | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Is the op-log + sidecar architecture acceptable? | It gates Phase 6 | Review ADR-0009 | Product/Eng | Open |
| D2 | Which tables and columns sync? | Scope and conflict surface | Data model review | Eng | Open |
| D3 | Is LWW acceptable, or must concurrent field edits merge? | Data loss vs complexity | Product decision | Product | Open |

| D5 | How long are ops retained, and when is compaction safe? | Database growth and restore | Design + load test | Eng | Answered - [ADR-0020](../decisions/0020-late-join-and-compaction.md), [#111](https://github.com/devstroop/ros/issues/111): compact after 128 durable new ops, retain 64 clocks per device, floor in `sync_state`, one transaction |
| D6 | Does a single-device install run the sidecar? | Simplicity vs one code path | Design | Eng | Open |
| D7 | Must Restaurant OS interoperate with the Flutter app during rollout? | Protocol compatibility | Product rollout plan | Product | Open |
| D8 | Is a cloud relay ever required? | Architecture | Product strategy | Product | Open |
| D9 | Who is the host, and what happens when it leaves? | Availability | Design + test | Eng | Open |
| D10 | What happens after a restore from backup with an old clock? | Correctness | Design + test | Eng | Open |
| D11 | How does a new device bootstrap: full snapshot or replay? | Time to join, data size | Design | Eng | Answered - [ADR-0020](../decisions/0020-late-join-and-compaction.md), [#111](https://github.com/devstroop/ros/issues/111): durable replay above the floor, snapshot when the cursor does not cover it |
| D12 | Are there regulatory constraints on LAN traffic? | Security | Legal/IT review | Product | Open |
| D13 | Are peers authenticated, and with what? | A trusted LAN means any device on the wire is a device in the restaurant. A shared secret in the handshake is the smallest answer that is not nothing. | Design | Eng | Open |
| D14 | Which app owns which entity, formally? | The ownership table in `architecture/12` is a proposal. Moving an entity between owners later is a protocol change. | Design review | Eng | Open |
| D15 | How are ops compacted into a snapshot, and when? | The log grows without bound and a device that joins late replays it. | Design + load test | Eng | Answered - [ADR-0020](../decisions/0020-late-join-and-compaction.md), [#111](https://github.com/devstroop/ros/issues/111): synthetic ops in `sync_snapshot_op`, header clocks adopted after the last page |
| D16 | What happens to the ops of a device that is removed from the restaurant? | The history of a sale outlives the till that took it | Product decision | Product | Open |
| D17 | What is the acceptable convergence latency, and is a poll enough? | The kitchen board must show a ticket when it is placed, not on the next tick | Measurement | Product | Open |
| D18 | Is the admin app the preferred bootstrap peer and the reference-data seed? | A peer design does not need a seed, but a restaurant with one always-on machine should not pay for a slower join | Design | Eng | Open |
| D19 | Does the PIN salt become per-employee, or does the installation salt replicate as reference data? | The PIN hash is computed from the **installation** salt and the sign-in matches it for equality, and each app has its own installation salt - so a second device cannot let a waiter in. **Answered: per-employee**, by [ADR-0018](../decisions/0018-the-pin-hash-is-the-employees.md) and [#95](https://github.com/devstroop/ros/issues/95) - the picker identifies the employee before it hashes, so the row is self-verifying and no shared secret crosses the wire. | Product decision + a migration | Product/Eng | Answered - ADR-0018, [#95](https://github.com/devstroop/ros/issues/95) |

## J. Unknown unknowns

These are areas where we do not yet know the right question. They are
listed so the team treats them as discovery work, not as solved.

| Area | Why we are blind | First move |
|---|---|---|
| **The rush** | No one has watched a real service at peak with Restaurant OS. Timing, interruptions and workarounds are invisible in code. | Shadow a lunch and dinner service; time each step. |
| **Hardware reality** | No target printer, drawer, scanner or card terminal has been tested. | Buy the three most common devices; run a hardware day. |
| **Legacy data reality** | We have not inspected real customer databases. | Collect anonymised copies; profile every column. |
| **Tax and legal** | Rules vary by jurisdiction and change; v1 may be wrong. | Accountant and legal review; a per-market checklist. |
| **Multi-device behaviour** | Sync has never run in Restaurant OS; human behaviour around conflicts is unknown. | Prototype fake-transport convergence, then a two-device pilot. |
| **Failure behaviour** | No one knows how staff react to a printer/DB/network failure mid-service. | Failure injection in a pilot; observe recovery. |
| **Accessibility** | No audit has been done; the SDK's a11y surface is not fully known. | Screen-reader and keyboard pass; contrast audit. |
| **Localisation** | The product may need languages and code pages we have not tested. | Market review; print a receipt in each language. |
| **Performance at scale** | Capacities are guesses; no fixture has 500 products or 10k orders. | Build large fixtures; measure nodes, memory, query time. |
| **Operator setup** | No real operator has installed Restaurant OS from scratch. | Usability test the setup flow on a clean machine. |
| **Support** | We do not know what a support call sounds like for Restaurant OS failure modes. | Interview support; design diagnostics from tickets. |
| **Security adversary** | The threat model is assumed, not observed. | Security review with a realistic device-access scenario. |
| **Data retention** | No one has asked customers how long they keep history. | Customer interviews + legal. |
| **The upgrade moment** | Cutover from v1 has never been rehearsed. | Dry-run on a real database and a real device. |
| **Pricing/licensing** | The `subscription` table exists with no product rule. | Product strategy. |

## Answered questions (kept for history)

| Is there a pie chart? | No; use bar/stacked bar | ADR-0010 |
| How long are ops retained, and when is compaction safe? | 128 new ops trigger it; keep 64 clocks per device; delete below the floor in one transaction | ADR-0020, #111, tests |
| How does a new device bootstrap? | Replay the durable log; if its cursor is below the floor, fetch and apply the snapshot first | ADR-0020, #111, tests |
| How are ops compacted, and when? | Synthetic create/status/payment ops in `sync_snapshot_op`, clocks in the header, adopted after the last page | ADR-0020, #111, tests |

## Adding a question

1. Put it in the category where the decision will be made.
2. State why it matters in one sentence.
3. Name the method that will answer it.
4. Give it an owner.
5. If it blocks a phase, link the phase and do not start the phase.
6. When answered, move it to the history table with the evidence.
