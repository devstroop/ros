# ADR-0004: Four roles in one binary

**Superseded by [ADR-0017](0017-three-apps-over-tcp-ip.md).** The tree
now ships three apps, and this record is kept for the context that led
to the split.

## Context

Restaurant OS serves four operating modes: admin, waiter, kitchen display and
customer display. v1 shipped one binary with a role enum and a route
guard; each device chose a role at launch.

The Native SDK can run multiple model-declared windows over one shared
model, and can hide window chrome for kiosks.

## Decision

**One binary, four roles, selected at runtime.** The role is model state
and decides the home screen, the rail and the allowed screens. Kiosk roles
(KDS, display) sign in by device; admin and waiter require a PIN.

The target delivery shape is **optional secondary windows over the same
model**: an admin machine can run POS, KDS and display simultaneously.
That part is Proposed and not built.

## Consequences

### Positive

- One artifact to build, sign and distribute.
- One schema and one set of repositories.
- A single machine can host several views (target).
- Kiosk devices need no user account.
- The permission matrix stays small and testable.

### Negative

- Kiosk actions are not attributable to an employee.
- A shared model means shared session state; a second window sees the
  admin's role.
- Multi-window window policy (which role opens what, close behaviour,
  kiosk chrome) is unresolved.
- A device cannot hand off a session between roles without signing out.

### Follow-ups

- Decide whether the device remembers its role across reboots.
- Decide how a kiosk exits (hidden gesture, PIN, menu chord).
- Decide whether secondary windows share the cart.
- If multi-window is not delivered, the role switch remains a full shell
  swap and the KDS must run on a separate machine.

## Alternatives considered

| Alternative | Why not |
|---|---|
| Four binaries | Four builds, four schemas, four release paths. |
| Role fixed at build time | Loses the "one installer" property and complicates support. |
| Web admin + native kiosk | Adds a second stack; contradicts the single-binary goal. |
| Separate processes per role | Duplicate state and a sync requirement on one machine. |

## Evidence

- `src/core/navigation.zig`: `Role`, `home`, `needs_sign_in`.
- `src/core/rbac.zig`: rail tables and the matrix.
- `app.json` and `src/main.zig`: one window today.
- `PORT-PLAN.md` §6: multi-window mapping.
