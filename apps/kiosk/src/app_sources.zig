//! The embedded markup import closure.
//!
//! Every file the markup imports must also be listed here: the runtime
//! engine's first build reads this set, and hot reload re-resolves the
//! same paths from disk. A missing entry fails loudly at the import
//! site - which is the point: a screen that is not compiled in is a
//! screen that does not exist.
//!
//! The list is the kiosk's partition: the session screens (the device
//! picker and the setup a fresh installation needs), the two boards, and
//! the order detail a ticket opens.
