# Restaurant OS

A restaurant operating system, written in Zig on the
[Native SDK](https://native-sdk.dev): **point of sale, back office,
waiter service and the kitchen and customer boards**, in three apps over
one shared package.

Restaurant OS keeps the product and rebuilds the machinery on a
native GPU canvas, an engine-owned SQLite store and a typed effect channel.

```sh
cd apps/admin       # or apps/service, apps/kiosk
native dev          # debug build + markup hot reload
native test         # headless update-logic and repository tests
native check        # manifest, markup and schema validation
native build        # ReleaseFast binary in zig-out/bin/
```

## Why Restaurant OS exists

v1 was a Flutter app: 400+ Dart files, a router, a reactive widget tree, a
vendored SQLite C library behind an FFI boundary, and a WebSocket sync stack
that lived inside the business logic. It worked, and it also taught us
exactly where the seams hurt:

| v1 problem | Restaurant OS answer |
|---|---|
| Money in `REAL` columns, rounded by the UI | **Money is `i64` minor units, everywhere.** No float money, ever. |
| PINs readable in the database | A credential is a **bcrypt hash**, salted with the person's own id; the plaintext never touches the disk, and a person chooses a PIN or a password |
| Permissions buried in a router `redirect:` | Permissions are a **pure function** (`core/rbac.zig`), with a test that walks every role against every screen |
| A router, a navigator, and a riverpod graph | **One model, one `update`.** Navigation is model state. |
| A second SQLite engine vendored into the app | **The platform's own store** — engine-owned, live queries, migrations included |
| Sync transport tangled into the domain | The app writes an **operation log**; the sync core owns the socket, in process ([ADR-0017](docs/decisions/0017-three-apps-over-tcp-ip.md)) |
| A 39-table schema with no type discipline | **46 STRICT tables** across twenty-one migrations, one concern per migration, checked at build time |
| Business logic and widgets in one tree | **Model / Msg / update** in Zig, declarative markup for the view, nothing in between |

The full comparison, the capability gaps and the reasoning behind every
decision are in [`docs/architecture/11-capability-gaps.md`](docs/architecture/11-capability-gaps.md)
and [`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/README.md).

## The shape of the app

The Native SDK's app model is small and strict, and everything in this repo
follows it:

```
Model  ── what is true              (src/core/model.zig)
Msg    ── what happened             (src/core/msg.zig)
update ── what is true now          (src/core/update.zig)
markup ── what the operator sees    (src/app.native, src/screens/*.native)
```

* The **markup never changes state.** It binds model values and dispatches
  messages. Every state change happens in `update`.
* **Derived values are methods, not fields.** Counts, totals and filtered
  lists are computed on rebuild, so they cannot drift from their inputs.
* **The world is reached through the effects channel.** The database, the
  clock, files, the clipboard, a printer - all of it is an effect with a
  typed result message. `update` stays a pure function of (model, message).
* **The app is testable without a window.** `native test` builds the view,
  dispatches messages the way the runtime does, and asserts on the model.

### Module map

```
packages/ros-core/src/     the shared package: model, messages, update,
                           domain, data, theme
apps/admin/                the back office shell (role: admin)
apps/service/              the waiter shell (role: waiter)
apps/kiosk/                the kitchen and customer boards (role: kds/display)

apps/<role>/src/
├── main.zig              the app: window, UiApp, runner wiring
├── app.native            the shell: title bar, nav rail, screen gates
├── app_sources.zig       the embedded import closure for the templates
├── schema/*.sql          the database: eleven migrations, all STRICT
├── screens/*.native      one template per screen the role mounts
└── tests.zig             the rules the app must not break
```

`apps/admin` carries the superset of the screens and is the source for
the copies the other two carry; `scripts/check-copies.sh` fails when a
copy drifts.

---

## The database

The schema lives in each app under `src/schema/` as numbered migrations and is
applied by the platform when the database opens. Three rules hold in every
table:

* **`STRICT` tables only.** A column's declared type means something.
* **Money is `INTEGER` minor units.** A price is an integer count of the
  smallest unit, never a float.
* **Time is `INTEGER` epoch milliseconds, UTC.** Every timestamp in the
  database has the same shape.

```sh
cd apps/admin
native db new-migration add_promotions   # appends src/schema/000N_add_promotions.sql
```

`native check` validates every migration against real SQLite at build time -
a non-STRICT table or a broken foreign key fails the check, not production.

The **operation log** (`op_log`) is the sync substrate: the app writes its
changes there and watches it with a live query, while a sidecar process owns
the WebSocket and the mDNS announcement. See
[`docs/architecture/08-sync.md`](docs/architecture/08-sync.md).

## Running it

### Requirements

| Tool | Version | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Zig | **0.16.0** | The SDK pins it. 0.17 does not parse the SDK. |
| Node | **24+** | The relational-schema generator is TypeScript. |
| Native SDK CLI | v0.11.0 | `native dev / test / check / build / automate` |

```sh
./scripts/setup.sh      # installs the toolchain and builds the SDK CLI
source ./scripts/env.sh # puts zig 0.16, node 24 and the CLI on PATH
```

### Everyday commands

```sh
scripts/verify-all.sh        # native check + native test for every app
scripts/build.sh         # ReleaseFast build of every app
scripts/dev.sh           # debug run of the app with markup hot reload

cd apps/admin
native automate wait                       # wait for the running app
native automate assert 'gpu_nonblank=true' # assert the window drew something
native automate snapshot                   # dump the widget tree
```

## Status

The foundation is in place and building: the app model, the permission
matrix, the four registers and the restaurant's own colour, the schema
(46 tables across twenty-one migrations), the repository layer, the
sign-in, the picker, first-run setup, the dashboard, the point of sale,
the order list, the floor, the kitchen board, the customer display, the
waiter shell, the settings screens and the catalogue and people forms.
Three binaries — `admin`, `service`, `kiosk` — share one core and talk to
each other over the LAN. The admin app's two suites hold 230 tests, the
service and kiosk suites 10 and 8, and `packages/ros-core` 46; together
they cover the model, navigation, markup, the wire and the SQL against
the database engine, and `scripts/verify-all.sh` runs all of them. The
money and back-office tracks are merged.

A person signs in as themselves. The picker names them, their own row
says whether the till offers a numeric pad or a password field, and
neither shows the secret. The sign-in checks the stored role against the
mode the device runs, waits for the database to confirm the installation
salt, and verifies the bcrypt hash the row carries — so a replicated row
is enough to sign in from. What is still missing is the paper: no
receipt, no KOT, and an order can still be closed unpaid.

The rest of the product is on the phase board in
[`docs/plan/README.md`](docs/plan/README.md), with the as-built screen
matrix in [`docs/plan/status.md`](docs/plan/status.md). The documentation
index is [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md); the dated findings are in
[`docs/review/archive/`](docs/review/archive/), and the open findings are
[issues](https://github.com/devstroop/ros/issues).

## Conventions that are not negotiable

1. **Markup never mutates state.** It binds and dispatches.
2. **Everything the view can see is a field or a method on `Model`.** A
   file-scope function next to the struct is invisible to the markup.
3. **Derived values are methods.** A stored field that could be computed is a
   bug waiting to drift.
4. **`view_unbound` lists what the view must not see.** Keep it honest.
5. **Money is integer minor units. Time is epoch milliseconds.**
6. **Every table is `STRICT`.**
7. **Files the markup binds are file-scope constants.** A composite literal
   built inside a function lives on that function's stack frame; returning a
   slice to it hands the view a pointer to dead memory. (This one bit us
   once already - see `core/rbac.zig`.)
8. **Tests are the rules.** If a rule matters, it is a test.

`AGENTS.md` has the long version, including the platform traps worth knowing
before you write a line of markup.
