//! The answers waiting for the net thread, one slot per connection.
//!
//! The loop thread writes; the net thread reads. Two atomic counters per
//! slot are enough, and they are enough *because* there is exactly one
//! producer and one consumer - which is a finding, not a preference.
//! `std.Thread.Mutex` is gone in Zig 0.16 and `std.Io.Mutex` takes the
//! `Io` it locks against; `update` has no `Io`, so a mutex is not
//! available to it. A single-producer/single-consumer ring is, and it
//! costs one release and one acquire.
//!
//! The slot is **per connection**, not a global ring. A frame carries no
//! peer id, so a shared ring would let one peer's answer reach another -
//! and a leftover answer from a connection that timed out would be handed
//! to the next connection that reused the slot. Each connection owns a
//! slot, cleared when it is accepted.
//!
//! An answer that does not fit is **refused and counted**, never
//! truncated: half a response on the socket is worse than none, and a
//! silent drop is a bug nobody finds.
