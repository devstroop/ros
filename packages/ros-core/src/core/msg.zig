//! The message vocabulary.
//!
//! Every state change in the app is one of these. The markup never
//! mutates anything - it dispatches a message, and `update` decides
//! what that means. That is the whole contract.
//!
//! Payload types are fixed by the platform for the messages the runtime
//! delivers (timers, text edits, database results). Messages the app
//! invents carry small scalars, so a template can dispatch them with
//! `on-press="pick_role:{id}"`.
