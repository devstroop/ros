//! The model: the single source of truth for what the app shows.
//!
//! Three house rules hold here, and they are the reason this file is
//! worth reading before any other:
//!
//!   1. **Everything the view can see is a field or a method on this
//!      struct.** A file-scope function next to the struct is invisible
//!      to the markup - the binding resolver only sees declarations
//!      INSIDE the struct body.
//!   2. **Derived values are methods, never stored fields.** Counts,
//!      sums, filtered views and formatted strings are computed on
//!      rebuild. A field that could be derived is a bug waiting to
//!      drift out of sync with its inputs.
//!   3. **Anything the view must NOT see is listed in `view_unbound`.**
//!      That declaration is the lint that keeps a private field from
//!      becoming an accidental public API.
//!
//! Storage note: the model owns its rows in fixed-capacity bump buffers
//! (see `core/bump.zig`). It has to be default-constructible - the
//! runtime builds it as `.{}` - so it cannot own a heap allocator, and
//! it must not borrow memory from the effects channel, whose payloads
//! are drain scratch that dies with the update.
