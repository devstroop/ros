//! Credential hashing.
//!
//! A PIN and a password are two different things to the person typing
//! them and one thing to this module: a short string of bytes that must
//! never be stored as it is. Eatery v1 stored PINs where a curious
//! operator could read them. Restaurant OS hashes them, and it hashes
//! them with a deliberately SLOW key-derivation function: bcrypt. A
//! stolen database is then expensive to turn back into secrets, which is
//! the whole difference between a PIN and a name on a list.
//!
//! What the two kinds differ in is the shape of the guess space, and
//! that is a rule about typing rather than about hashing: six digits is
//! a hundred thousand guesses, and a password of eight mixed characters
//! is not a number anybody can state. The lengths below are therefore
//! per kind, and the hash is not.
//!
//! The hash is a versioned string - bcrypt's own crypt format,
//! "$2b$10$<salt>$<digest>" - and it carries the cost and the salt
//! with it. That is what makes it versioned: the cost can be raised
//! later, the old hashes still verify, and a hash written by a future
//! version of the app is readable by this one.
//!
//! The salt is the installation's AND the employee's, so two
//! restaurants with the same PIN do not share a hash, and two
//! employees in one restaurant with the same PIN do not either.
//!
//! It is DERIVED rather than random, because `update` is pure: it has
//! no randomness to draw from, so a salt it makes has to come from
//! something it already has. The employee's id is that something - it
//! is known when the hash is made, because the sign-in already knows
//! which person it is checking.
//!
//! This module is pure - no clock, no allocation, no effects - so it
//! runs inside `update` without breaking the model-is-a-pure-function
//! rule. It is also slow on purpose: that is the point of it.
