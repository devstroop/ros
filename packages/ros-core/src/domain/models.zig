//! Domain entities.
//!
//! One file for the whole vocabulary: these are the shapes the database
//! rows decode into and the shapes the view renders. Two house rules
//! hold everywhere in this file:
//!
//!   * **Money is `i64` minor units.** Never a float. A rupee, a cent or
//!     a yen is an integer; the currency decides the scale. Eatery v1 kept
//!     money in REAL columns and lost cents to rounding - that class of bug
//!     does not get a second chance here.
//!   * **Time is `i64` epoch milliseconds, UTC.** Every timestamp in the
//!     database is the same shape, so ordering and range queries need no
//!     per-column knowledge.
//!
//! Text is `[]const u8` owned by the loader, never by the model: rows are
//! decoded into an arena the view owns and dropped with it.
